# Shopping-Customer-Segmentation
Python Project on Jupyter Notebook
1. Clustered 5,000+ customer records using K-Means algorithm, identifying 4 distinct shopper segments based on 
purchasing behavior and spending patterns. 
2. Optimized clustering efficiency by 30% through feature scaling and PCA, leveraging Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit
Learn) for improved data processing and visualization.
